# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Performance Evaluation: Artha Optimum vs Benchmark portfolio** and is a comparison of the returns and risk levels of holding the fund Artha Optimum (a medium risk-profile fund listed on OMX Copenhagen) against a comparable portfolio. The portfolio consists of 50 % in Nykredits mortgage bond index (a well known benchmark for danish bond mortgages), and 50 % in MSCIs World index ( a well known benchmark for global stocks). 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. IndeksData_udenmakro.xlsx (Bloomberg) 
1. Kurshistorik, safemax.xlsx (Artha)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install datetime``
``pip install plotly``
``pip install chart_studio``
``pip installrequests``

Install by opening you commando prompt terminal and pasting in the above packages one by one
